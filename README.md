RAG-powered Research Paper Assistant

This project is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application built with Python and Streamlit to assist users in querying research papers. It allows users to either upload PDF files or search for papers on arXiv, processes the content, stores it in a vector database (ChromaDB), and answers queries using semantic search and a generative AI model (Gemini).
